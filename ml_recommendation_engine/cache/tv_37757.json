        "overview": "Heng, a bachelor working in a real estate company whose love life is as hopeless as his work life, stumbles upon his own photos on the phone and computer of branch manager Kongdech, his boss. Heng certainly finds this behaviour strange, considering that his boss was married for thirty years.\n\nWhen Kongdech confesses, it shocks Heng who's never liked men before, and it doesn't help that it's come from his amazing boss. And as if things weren't confusing enough, his new colleague and roommate Mo also falls for him. Heng finds himself in a messy situation with two men fighting for his heart. To make matters even more complicated, his childhood friend Chicha unexpectedly confesses her love for him as well.  Amid this whirlwind of emotions and tangled relationships, who will ultimately win Heng's heart?",
